# Tephra-EPMA-Lab-Workflows-Database
Database and data exchange to support tephra laboratory workflows and EPMA data management

Project aims to build a system inspired by https://sparrow-data.org to facilitate more efficient capture, management, and sharing of data and metadata produced in tephra (volcanic ash) laboratories

Project partially supported by US NSF grants 1928341 (2018-2024) and 2411331 (2024-2027)

Intended components include (a) database schema and implementation, (b) web frontend, (c) other data input-output mechanisms

Intended data type coverages include:
- people/researchers
- projects
- publications
- institutions
- research funding
- samples
- sample collection context - field stations, cores, stratigraphy
- sample preparation
- curation of samples and prepared sub-fractions
- prepared analytical targets (e.g. thin sections, volcanic ash mounts)
- analytical instruments
- analytical methods
- instrument sessions (batches)
- grain size data
- geochemical data
- images, both optical and electron microscopy

System is intended to respect data ownership and access rights primarily at the level of project
